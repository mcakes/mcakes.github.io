    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
      As seems to be a recurring theme on recent trips, this one's not going according to plan.
      On Saturday we were turned around by OPP at Elk Lake 'coz the hwy was closed due to a forest fire to the west. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Alan was en route from Thunder Bay so we arranged to meet on hwy 11 and discuss alternatives.
      We put in at McLean L on the infamous Red Squirrel Road and paddled up into Anima Nipissing L 
      where we set up camp on a large rock outcrop overlooking the lake. 
      Along the shore the low cliff below our tents is adorned with ancient pictographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan stayed until Wednesday when Dan & I accompanied him back to the road. 
      During that time we enjoyed each other's company, reminiscing, laughing, even crying, and failing yet again to solve the worlds problems. 
      We spent hours watching suckers work their way up the creek beside camp, watching the clouds come and go, huddling under the rain tarp, and eating!
    </p> 
    <p>
      Alan brought food for all, was the chief cook and never failed to amaze us at his culinary creations. 
      Pancakes with Rum stands out as an example destined to become a weekly staple!
      All in all it was a stellar reminder that Al is one of the nicest people in the world to spend a relaxing time with. 
      He regaled us with stories of his explorations of the Wabikimi area near his home as well as other parts of the world, 
      growing up in Newfoundland and spoke at length about his growing family.
      I was so sorry to see him depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also discovered I can't physically fit a month of food and my gear in my little canoe. 
      Three weeks seems to be the absolute max. Live & learn....
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm camped at home for a couple of days. Gonna repack, regroup and head out for Smoothwater Monday.
      With the weather moving in, long weekend campsite competition and more importantly the threat of ranger danger 
      (we're travelling without permits.... Shhhhh!) we decided to wait until Monday when things should quieten down in there. 
      Dan and I are planning a shortened version of our Smith Lake trip and then I'll have just 
      over two weeks to move through the high country and down to Alex's for mid-June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weather this week was mixed. Mostly cool, but not unpleasant. 
      A few rain showers, but nothing that created any issues. 
      We were mostly well sheltered from the wind and bugs only made their feeble presence known a few times.
      That's all for this week. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers,
      <br />
      Paul

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>Nice easy paddle against a diminishing light headwind. Camped on Smoothwater.</p>
    <p>
      Day 11 saw us heading to Smith L (10am) but 1st portage gave us grief. 
      Landing was marked in wrong place but short search located the actual trail(85m). 
      Upper end was choked with a raft of floating (& sunken) logs. 
      It took some time to brush out the trail & clear a path for canoes through the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reached the second portage (we think) around 1 &  ate lunch before scouting the trail. 
      After over 2 hrs of thrashing we had failed to locate any song of a trail. 
      Getting late in the day, &  unprepared for a 2km uphill bushwhack, we reluctantly 
      turned back & set up camp on Smoothwater again. Day 12 we set out again for Smith L, 
      this time via Smith Creek, based on info I rec'd via satellite.  
      At the limit of navigability, where the creek ends a long tumble over steep, rocky drops I found a tree blaze on river left!

    <h2>Week 3<h2>
    <p>A brutally hard week of traveling! </p>
    <p>
      Day 15 saw Dan & I climb cliff on Marina L for view over it and Smoothwater. 
      Park rangers portaged right through our camp without checking for the permits we didnâ€™t have! YEEHAW!!
    </p>
    <p> Day 16 I left Dan and moved south. 10km of walking, 6km hauling 55, 65 & 75 lb loads! Buggiest camp ever!  </p>
    <p> Day 17 was steep uphill on trapper trail. 4 loads!!! Exhausting!  <p
    <p> Day 18 took 8 hrs to move 3km! 4 very steep carries on 2 portages. Made it to Broken Pelvis Lake and took a couple days off.  </p>
    <p> Day 19 in camp with rain & repairs. </p>
    <p> Day 20 hiked trail along Pilgrim Cr past Scarecrow Cut. Had conversation with a beaver. Beaverspeak sounds like mournful whalesong! </p>
    <p> Day 21 headed for Chivers L but only got to Horseshoe L. 9 hrs to go 3km! Afternoon t-storm delayed progress. Another big one in evening. </p>
    <p> Day 22 made it to Chivers Island! Showers & sun all day. Saw a full rainbow over the Mtn across the lake with both ends touching down IN the lake! Stunning! </p>
    <p> Day 23 relaxing in camp. Probably go for a hike this aft.  </p>
