    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
      As seems to be a recurring theme on recent trips, this one's not going according to plan.
      On Saturday we were turned around by OPP at Elk Lake 'coz the hwy was closed due to a forest fire to the west. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Alan was en route from Thunder Bay so we arranged to meet on hwy 11 and discuss alternatives.
      We put in at McLean L on the infamous Red Squirrel Road and paddled up into Anima Nipissing L 
      where we set up camp on a large rock outcrop overlooking the lake. 
      Along the shore the low cliff below our tents is adorned with ancient pictographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan stayed until Wednesday when Dan & I accompanied him back to the road. 
      During that time we enjoyed each other's company, reminiscing, laughing, even crying, and failing yet again to solve the worlds problems. 
      We spent hours watching suckers work their way up the creek beside camp, watching the clouds come and go, huddling under the rain tarp, and eating!
    </p> 
    <p>
      Alan brought food for all, was the chief cook and never failed to amaze us at his culinary creations. 
      Pancakes with Rum stands out as an example destined to become a weekly staple!
      All in all it was a stellar reminder that Al is one of the nicest people in the world to spend a relaxing time with. 
      He regaled us with stories of his explorations of the Wabikimi area near his home as well as other parts of the world, 
      growing up in Newfoundland and spoke at length about his growing family.
      I was so sorry to see him depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also discovered I can't physically fit a month of food and my gear in my little canoe. 
      Three weeks seems to be the absolute max. Live & learn....
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm camped at home for a couple of days. Gonna repack, regroup and head out for Smoothwater Monday.
      With the weather moving in, long weekend campsite competition and more importantly the threat of ranger danger 
      (we're travelling without permits.... Shhhhh!) we decided to wait until Monday when things should quieten down in there. 
      Dan and I are planning a shortened version of our Smith Lake trip and then I'll have just 
      over two weeks to move through the high country and down to Alex's for mid-June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weather this week was mixed. Mostly cool, but not unpleasant. 
      A few rain showers, but nothing that created any issues. 
      We were mostly well sheltered from the wind and bugs only made their feeble presence known a few times.
      That's all for this week. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers,
      <br />
      Paul

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>Nice easy paddle against a diminishing light headwind. Camped on Smoothwater.</p>
    <p>
      Day 11 saw us heading to Smith L (10am) but 1st portage gave us grief. 
      Landing was marked in wrong place but short search located the actual trail(85m). 
      Upper end was choked with a raft of floating (& sunken) logs. 
      It took some time to brush out the trail & clear a path for canoes through the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reached the second portage (we think) around 1 &  ate lunch before scouting the trail. 
      After over 2 hrs of thrashing we had failed to locate any song of a trail. 
      Getting late in the day, &  unprepared for a 2km uphill bushwhack, we reluctantly 
      turned back & set up camp on Smoothwater again. Day 12 we set out again for Smith L, 
      this time via Smith Creek, based on info I rec'd via satellite.  
      At the limit of navigability, where the creek ends a long tumble over steep, rocky drops I found a tree blaze on river left!

      Day 15 saw Dan & I climb cliff on Marina L for view over it and Smoothwater. 
      Park rangers portaged right through our camp without checking for the permits we didn't have! YEEHAW!!

      I left Dan and moved south. 10km of walking, 6km hauling 55, 65 & 75 lb loads! Buggiest camp ever!

    Made it to Chivers Island! Showers & sun all day. Saw a full rainbow over the Mtn across the lake with both ends touching down IN the lake! Stunning!

    Relaxing in camp. Probably go for a hike this aft. 
    <br />
    After writing & sending Week 3 updates went for a hike to locate a cliff top Lookout I'd noticed a few years ago from the water but was unable to find it. 
    On the way noticed an odd sensation in my right foot that later became obvious as a symptom of a building sciatica attack.

    A rain day. Rearranged my gazebo, made a few repairs & finished my last e-cigarette. Back/leg pain increasing.

    Very restless sleep with back pain. Moved to Bluesucker Lake. 11 hrs to make 11 km w/ 5 portages. 
    Had to cut & flag a 500m portage & last one was just a ridiculous bushcrash. 
    In camp late, supper at 10 & forgot to send location updates. My location was: 47.16374, -80.59473.

    Moved to Talking Falls, 4km with one portage, 135m took over an hour! Slipped & gashed my arm. T-storm hit just after setting up bug shelter.

    Restless night. Took over 5 hours to pack up & go. 7 hrs to make 8 km w/ 4 short portages. 
    Can carry pack loads ok but canoe is agony. Walking upright near impossible. 
    Setting up camp agony, specially overhead work stringing tarp ropes. Supper after 10 again & forgot to send locations.

    Hard to get comfortable sleep. Answered messages from last 2 days. Overhauled malfunctioning stove. 
    Saw 1st human since leaving Dan Day 16. Dan from Pittsburgh on a solo trip. 
    Resting today and if back not better will arrange a partial extraction at Twinkle L. 
    (a few hours travel and 3 short portages from here) & go to Alex's on Obabika to recoup. 
    Have been on ibuprofen since day 24 & periodic 1/4 Perc when moving 
    (might explain some of the tumbles I've taken).

    Day 30 & 31 were spent in & around camp on Seagram Lake, a diversely varied lake of considerable beauty. 
    One day I caught a lake trout from camp for breakfast, had canned herring for lunch and then caught a smallmouth bass for supper. 
    Felt like Fish Friday! 
    On day 31 I paddled to the east end of Seagram & scouted an old road as a possible extraction route, but couldn't definitively conclude its viability.`

    Wanted to stay another day on Seagram. 
    It continued to be incredibly calm and pleasant, surrounding vibrant spring greens at their peak. 
    Prudence dictated I move to my pickup point, normally only a couple of hours away. 
    Packed slowly, pain complicating things. 
    On the go at 1 but slow & painful on the portages, beaver dams and other obstructions. 
    Gear on pickup road at 6. Setup my tent on the road and strung a tarp and bug bag on the portage for a cooking/lounging area. 
    Supper after 9.

    Pack up camp and get ready for Don & Pete, who left North Bay 9:15, to arrive. 
    When they hadn't arrived by 2 I began to get concerned. By 5 i was very concerned! Not for myself. 
    I had shelter and food for the night. They had only the truck for shelter & who knows what scenario? 
    Turns out there were navigation problems leading to low fuel forcing a retreat. 
    Alex sent his son-in-law to bring me to Obabika.

    The guys arrive with a month's supplies & some summer gear plus lots of fresh fruit & other foods.
    I'm able to backup the photos & videos I've shot so far to my laptop & send it back. 
    We spend the evening relaxing with Alex.

    After a hearty breakfast the guys head out around 1 and suddenly my cabin is very quiet. 
    The wind changes& picks up, temperature drops,& I realize my good fortune here on the cabin. 
    I sent my warm sleeping bag & all long underwear out with the guys so would've been on the edge if id found myself out in a tent bearing the brunt of that weather.

    Spent the week recuperating at Alex's. 
    Spent the days in and around my cabin, stretching, hobbling & lying around eating assorted painkillers and anti-inflamatories. 
    Got all my laundry done over several days.
    I was seriously considering pulling the plug on this whole project & calling for a ride out when things began to show improvement…
    It would seem that the chin-up bar I rigged up and used as a traction device started to make a difference!
    Yesterday was the first day in almost 3 weeks I didn't take painkillers.
    Also got out in my canoe for short spins the last 2 days, something I hadn't done in over a week.
    I'm gonna see how this weekend goes and may move out of the cabin in the next day or two. We'll see…

    You wouldn't believe how reluctant I was to do this but…. 
    I called Don to come and take me out. 
    Don't know yet when that'll happen, but should be next few days. I've gotta be realistic. 
    I've been stalled for over two weeks now. Today is Day 45 of the trip and Day 21 of pain…. ☹️`
