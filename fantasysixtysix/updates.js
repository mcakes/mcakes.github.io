    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
      As seems to be a recurring theme on recent trips, this one's not going according to plan.
      On Saturday we were turned around by OPP at Elk Lake 'coz the hwy was closed due to a forest fire to the west. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Alan was en route from Thunder Bay so we arranged to meet on hwy 11 and discuss alternatives.
      We put in at McLean L on the infamous Red Squirrel Road and paddled up into Anima Nipissing L 
      where we set up camp on a large rock outcrop overlooking the lake. 
      Along the shore the low cliff below our tents is adorned with ancient pictographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan stayed until Wednesday when Dan & I accompanied him back to the road. 
      During that time we enjoyed each other's company, reminiscing, laughing, even crying, and failing yet again to solve the worlds problems. 
      We spent hours watching suckers work their way up the creek beside camp, watching the clouds come and go, huddling under the rain tarp, and eating!
    </p> 
    <p>
      Alan brought food for all, was the chief cook and never failed to amaze us at his culinary creations. 
      Pancakes with Rum stands out as an example destined to become a weekly staple!
      All in all it was a stellar reminder that Al is one of the nicest people in the world to spend a relaxing time with. 
      He regaled us with stories of his explorations of the Wabikimi area near his home as well as other parts of the world, 
      growing up in Newfoundland and spoke at length about his growing family.
      I was so sorry to see him depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also discovered I can't physically fit a month of food and my gear in my little canoe. 
      Three weeks seems to be the absolute max. Live & learn....
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm camped at home for a couple of days. Gonna repack, regroup and head out for Smoothwater Monday.
      With the weather moving in, long weekend campsite competition and more importantly the threat of ranger danger 
      (we're travelling without permits.... Shhhhh!) we decided to wait until Monday when things should quieten down in there. 
      Dan and I are planning a shortened version of our Smith Lake trip and then I'll have just 
      over two weeks to move through the high country and down to Alex's for mid-June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weather this week was mixed. Mostly cool, but not unpleasant. 
      A few rain showers, but nothing that created any issues. 
      We were mostly well sheltered from the wind and bugs only made their feeble presence known a few times.
      That's all for this week. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers,
      <br />
      Paul

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>Nice easy paddle against a diminishing light headwind. Camped on Smoothwater.</p>
    <p>
      Day 11 saw us heading to Smith L (10am) but 1st portage gave us grief. 
      Landing was marked in wrong place but short search located the actual trail(85m). 
      Upper end was choked with a raft of floating (& sunken) logs. 
      It took some time to brush out the trail & clear a path for canoes through the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reached the second portage (we think) around 1 &  ate lunch before scouting the trail. 
      After over 2 hrs of thrashing we had failed to locate any song of a trail. 
      Getting late in the day, &  unprepared for a 2km uphill bushwhack, we reluctantly 
      turned back & set up camp on Smoothwater again. Day 12 we set out again for Smith L, 
      this time via Smith Creek, based on info I rec'd via satellite.  
      At the limit of navigability, where the creek ends a long tumble over steep, rocky drops I found a tree blaze on river left!

      Day 15 saw Dan & I climb cliff on Marina L for view over it and Smoothwater. 
      Park rangers portaged right through our camp without checking for the permits we didn't have! YEEHAW!!

    Relaxing in camp. Probably go for a hike this aft. 
    <br />
    After writing & sending Week 3 updates went for a hike to locate a cliff top Lookout I'd noticed a few years ago from the water but was unable to find it. 
    On the way noticed an odd sensation in my right foot that later became obvious as a symptom of a building sciatica attack.

    Very restless sleep with back pain. Moved to Bluesucker Lake. 11 hrs to make 11 km w/ 5 portages. 
    Had to cut & flag a 500m portage & last one was just a ridiculous bushcrash. 
    In camp late, supper at 10 & forgot to send location updates. My location was: 47.16374, -80.59473.

    Restless night. Took over 5 hours to pack up & go. 7 hrs to make 8 km w/ 4 short portages. 
    Can carry pack loads ok but canoe is agony. Walking upright near impossible. 
    Setting up camp agony, specially overhead work stringing tarp ropes. Supper after 10 again & forgot to send locations.

    Hard to get comfortable sleep. Answered messages from last 2 days. Overhauled malfunctioning stove. 
    Saw 1st human since leaving Dan Day 16. Dan from Pittsburgh on a solo trip. 
    Resting today and if back not better will arrange a partial extraction at Twinkle L. 
    (a few hours travel and 3 short portages from here) & go to Alex's on Obabika to recoup. 
    Have been on ibuprofen since day 24 & periodic 1/4 Perc when moving 
    (might explain some of the tumbles I've taken).]
